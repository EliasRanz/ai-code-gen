# AI-UI-Generator Internal Code Refactoring Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the refactoring plan to bring the `internal` codebase into compliance with the established coding standards.

## Current Violations Identified

### 1. File Size Violations (>500 lines)
- `internal/llm/vllm_client.go` (640 lines) → Split into multiple files
- `internal/generation/service.go` (622 lines) → Extract components
- `internal/user/grpc_server.go` (589 lines) → Separate concerns

### 2. Missing Test Coverage
- **CRITICAL**: Zero test files found in `internal/`
- Required: 90% test coverage across all code
- Need: Unit, integration, performance, and security tests

### 3. Architecture Issues
- Mixed responsibilities in single files
- Need to verify Clean Architecture compliance
- Potential circular dependency issues

## Refactoring Strategy

### Phase 1: Test Infrastructure Setup
1. Create test directory structure
2. Add test utilities and mocks
3. Set up test configuration
4. Create CI/CD test automation

### Phase 2: File Size Compliance
1. Split large files into focused components
2. Extract utility functions
3. Separate concerns by responsibility
4. Maintain Clean Architecture layers

### Phase 3: Function Size Compliance
1. Identify functions >50 lines
2. Extract sub-functions with single responsibilities
3. Improve readability and maintainability

### Phase 4: Architecture Validation
1. Verify Clean Architecture compliance
2. Eliminate circular dependencies
3. Ensure proper layer separation
4. Add missing interfaces

### Phase 5: Documentation & Standards
1. Add godoc comments to all public APIs
2. Improve code clarity
3. Add error handling validation
4. Security review and hardening

## Implementation Order

### 1. Immediate Actions (High Priority)
- [ ] Set up test infrastructure
- [ ] Split `vllm_client.go` into focused files
- [ ] Add unit tests for domain layer
- [ ] Create integration test framework

### 2. Short Term (Medium Priority)  
- [ ] Refactor `generation/service.go`
- [ ] Split `user/grpc_server.go`
- [ ] Add comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Implement CI/CD test automation

### 3. Long Term (Lower Priority)
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Security hardening
- [ ] Documentation improvements
- [ ] Code quality automation

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All files ≤500 lines (≤300 preferred)
- [ ] All functions ≤50 lines (≤40 preferred)
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage achieved
- [ ] No circular dependencies
- [ ] Clean Architecture compliance
- [ ] All tests passing in CI/CD
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation

## Notes
- Maintain backward compatibility during refactoring
- Use feature flags for any breaking changes
- Document all architectural decisions in ADRs
- Regular code review and validation
