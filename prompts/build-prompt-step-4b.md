# Step 4b: Repository Pattern and CRUD Stubs

## Instructions

- Implement the repository pattern in `internal/user/repository.go` and related files for users and projects.
- Wire up the User/Project Service to use these repositories for CRUD stubs.
- Do not implement full business logic or validation yetâ€”focus on scaffolding and stubs.

**After completing this step, validate that the repository code compiles and the service can start.**
