# Step 6c: Authentication Flow Stubs

## Instructions

- Scaffold the authentication flow for the frontend (login page, next-auth setup, JWT/refresh token handling stubs).
- Do not implement full authentication logic yetâ€”focus on structure and stubs.

**After completing this step, validate that the login page and auth flow stubs are present and the app still starts.**
