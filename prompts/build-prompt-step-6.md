- Create the Next.js app structure as described.
- Implement placeholder components: ChatInterface.tsx, PreviewPane.tsx.
- Implement a basic SSE client (sse.ts).
- Scaffold authentication flow (login page, next-auth setup, JWT/refresh token handling stubs).
- Do not implement detailed UI or business logic yet.
