# Step 6a: Next.js App Structure and Routing

## Instructions

- Scaffold the Next.js app structure as described in the architecture.
- Implement basic routing and layout (e.g., dashboard, auth pages).
- Do not implement UI components or business logic yetâ€”focus on structure and navigation.

**After completing this step, validate that the app starts and routes work as expected.**
