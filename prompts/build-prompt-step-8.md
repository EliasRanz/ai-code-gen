# Step 8: Incremental Business Logic, Integration, and Testing

## Instructions

For each service, incrementally implement business logic, integration, and tests as described in the original system prompt. Focus on one feature or service at a time, and ensure all tests pass before proceeding.

- Implement business logic for each service in small, testable increments.
- Integrate services and ensure end-to-end flows work.
- Write and run tests for each feature before moving to the next.
- Repeat as needed for all features and services.
