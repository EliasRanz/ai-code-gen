# Step 6b: ChatInterface, PreviewPane, and SSE Client

## Instructions

- Implement placeholder components: ChatInterface.tsx, PreviewPane.tsx.
- Implement a basic SSE client (sse.ts).
- Do not implement detailed UI or business logic yetâ€”focus on scaffolding and stubs.

**After completing this step, validate that the components render and the SSE client can connect (even if to a stub endpoint).**
