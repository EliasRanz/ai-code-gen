# Step 9: Final Integration and End-to-End (E2E) Tests

## Objective
Integrate all developed features and services into a unified system. Implement and execute end-to-end (E2E) tests to validate the complete workflow and ensure system-wide functionality.

## Agent Instructions
1. **Integration**
   - Combine all modules, services, and features developed in previous steps.
   - Resolve any integration issues, such as interface mismatches or data flow problems.
   - Ensure all components communicate and function together as intended.

2. **E2E Test Planning**
   - Define realistic user scenarios that exercise the full system, covering all major features and edge cases.
   - Document the test plan, including expected inputs, outputs, and success criteria.

3. **E2E Test Implementation**
   - Write automated E2E tests using the project's preferred testing framework.
   - Ensure tests cover:
     - User journeys from start to finish
     - Interactions between all integrated components
     - Error handling and edge cases

4. **Validation**
   - Run all E2E tests and report results.
   - Debug and resolve any failures or inconsistencies.
   - Confirm that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements.

5. **Documentation & Handover**
   - Summarize integration and testing outcomes.
   - Document any known issues, limitations, or follow-up actions.
   - Prepare the system for deployment or further review.

## Best Practices
- Use clear, reproducible test cases and document all steps.
- Automate as much of the integration and testing process as possible.
- Maintain logs and artifacts for traceability.
- Collaborate with downstream agents or stakeholders for final validation.
