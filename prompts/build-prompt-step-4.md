# Step 4: Database Schema, Repository Pattern, and User/Project Service Integration

## Instructions

Implement the PostgreSQL schema, repository pattern, and wire up the User/Project Service to use these repositories. Provide CRUD stubs for users and projects, but do not implement full business logic or validation yet.

- Write the SQL schema for users, projects, chat_sessions, and chat_messages tables.
- Implement the repository pattern in `internal/user/repository.go`.
- Wire up the User/Project Service to use these repositories for CRUD stubs.
- Do not implement full business logic or validation yet.
