# Step 4a: Database Schema and Migrations

## Instructions

- Write the SQL schema for users, projects, chat_sessions, and chat_messages tables as described in the architecture.
- Provide migration scripts or instructions for initializing the database schema.
- Do not implement repository code or CRUD logic yetâ€”focus only on schema and migrations.

**After completing this step, validate that the schema is correct and can be applied to a fresh PostgreSQL instance.**
